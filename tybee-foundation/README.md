## Quickstart

* psql -U postgres 
* psql -U postgres -p 5432 -h localhost

## What's Already Here
* Typescript + Static typing ðŸŽ‰
* Makes use of ts-gist-pile ðŸŽ‰
* Leave in logging with d4l ðŸŽ‰
* Dependency injection ðŸŽ‰

* Currently makes use of Inversify but NOT Reflect-metadata
* Git LFS
* Postgres connectivity
* Merge users + groups into entities
* Dynamic server-generated HTML pages.   Like old-school Rails.
* No APIs.  No SPA.
